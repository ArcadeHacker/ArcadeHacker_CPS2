// CPS2 Desuicider 1.05 by arcadehacker.blogspot.com

// Changes
// Version 1.01: [Artemio] Moved strings and keys to flash memory.
// Version 1.02: [Artemio] Removed spaces from game names, refactored code a bit, added left and right menu navigation.
// Version 1.03: [Artemio] Changed startup and end values in lines for consistent results on boards without CN9
// Version 1.04: [Eduardo] Removed clones. Revised clock delay for improved compatibility
// Version 1.05: [Eduardo] Fixed keys for batcirj, spf2t. Added games: ringdesth, spf2tu, ssf2th. Thank you smf.
